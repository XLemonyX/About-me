Use the visualization to:\n\nState which category of the variable repeat purchases has the most observations\n\nExplain whether the observations are balanced across categories of the variable repeat purchases\n\n![repeat_purchases](repeat_purchases.PNG)\n\nThere are 7 categories of products included in this data. The most common type listed is Equipment having the most observations. Next four categories are balanced and there is very little difference between them. The last two categories being Accessories and Unknown category having the least number of repeat purchases. Understanding which specific equipment products are being resold, will give PetMind a clearer picture of the daily needs of their customers.","metadata":{},"id":"1d5ba38c-1b3a-4f9b-bf38-bb0a62dac346","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## Task 3","metadata":{},"id":"ce5f6df2-fbf2-4c44-9209-9ee668876b53","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"Describe the distribution of all of the sales. Your answer must include a visualization that shows the distribution.\n\n![distribution](distribution.PNG)\n\nLooking at the distribution of sales, we can see from the graph above that the median value for the sales is is around 1000. The distribution of the number of sales is normal. There are some outliers that get more than 2256 sales but this is very uncommon, I would suggest investigate which products fall in the outliers section of the graph, to try and understand why they were sold more than others.\n\n","metadata":{},"id":"8fcff247-db49-42c0-8710-51848aeb6347","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## Task 4","metadata":{},"id":"c5fbe3a0-d277-437c-a1a0-f1edf80684f7","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"Describe the relationship between repeat purchases and sales.

Sales increase with the amount of repeat purchases. We can conclude that companys's approach over the last year contributed to increasing sales of every day products in repeated manner.","metadata":{},"id":"170dd2ea-340f-4ab4-94c8-fe077342e98e","cell_type":"markdown"}],"metadata":{"colab":{"name":"Welcome to DataCamp Workspaces.ipynb","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.8.10"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
