# Hi! üë®‚Äçüî¨
I'm passionate about Data Analysis, Statistics, and Data Visualisation. This repo holds some of my work that showcases how I go around data analysis and visualisation. If you wish to seek more about me, feel free to visit my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/natalia-g-12ba74232/).

# My Projects:

### 1. Pet Supplies
Tools: MS Excel, SQL, Google Sheets

Skills: Data Visualisation, Statistics, Data Cleaning and Analysis

Output: Written analysis

Pet Box Subscription analysis is a descriptive analysis of a pet store, which was done for my Data Analyst Associate certification. Goal of this projest was to clean, analyse an visualise data in a clear, understandable way and draw correct conclusions using three different visualisation showing distribution and relationship within data. Data was cleaned and prepared with MS Excel. Data visualization is done with Google Sheets. 

My final submission consisted of a written report for Data Analyst at Data Camp, who reviewed my proposal and reviewed that the analysis meets current industry standards. You can view it [here](https://github.com/XLemonyX/XLemonyX/blob/main/notebook.ipynb).

### 2. Analyzing Students' Mental Health
Tools: SQL, Python

Skills: Data Visualisation, Statistics, Data Analysis

Output: Written analysis

In this project I analize Students' mental health data. Goal of this projest was to explore the students data using PostgreSQL to find out if international students have a higher risk of mental health difficulties than the general population and see if the length of stay is a contributing factor. Analysis was done using SQL and Python which was also used for visualisaton using Pandas and Matplotlib.
