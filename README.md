Pet Box Subscription analysis is a descriptive analysis of a pet store, which was done for my Data Analyst Associate certification. This analysis aims to identify pet owners who could purchase stuff every month (food, toys, medical supplies...). The data was cleaned and prepared with MS Excel. Data visualization is done with Google Sheets. 

My final submission consisted of a written report for Data Analyst at Data Camp, who reviewed my proposal and reviewed that the analysis meets current industry standards. You can view it in (my DataCamp workspace)[https://app.datacamp.com/workspace/w/4bd851e9-46bd-4e9c-8237-853ee419a72c]
